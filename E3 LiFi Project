Lifi Project
Lifi stands for Light Fidelity high-speed, bidirectional network that transmits data using light. 
Unlike it's counterpart WiFi, which uses radio frequency waves for data transmission, LiFi technology only needs a light source with a chip to transmit an internet signal through light waves.
It operates in the visible light spectrum of the electromagnetic spectrum .it uses visible light as a medium of transmission rather than traditional radio waves
Some of the advantages of LiFi are :-
1)can be widely used in electromagnetic sensitive areas, such as, hospitals, airplanes, and nuclear power plants
2)better security as compared to Wi-Fi
3)solves the problem of radio frequency congestion
