Lifi Project
Lifi stands for Light Fidelity high-speed, bidirectional network that transmits data using light. 
Unlike it's counterpart WiFi, which uses radio frequency waves for data transmission, LiFi technology only needs a light source with a chip to transmit an internet signal through light waves.
It operates in the visible light spectrum of the electromagnetic spectrum .it uses visible light as a medium of transmission rather than traditional radio waves
Some of the advantages of LiFi are :-
1)can be widely used in electromagnetic sensitive areas, such as, hospitals, airplanes, and nuclear power plants
2)better security as compared to Wi-Fi
3)solves the problem of radio frequency congestion

While Wi-Fi covers an entire house, school, the bandwidth is limited to 50-100 megabits per seconds (Mbps). It is a mostly current Internet services, but insufficient for moving large data files such as HDTV movies,
music libraries and video games. Most of the dependent upon the cloud or our own media services to store all of our files, including audio and video devices, movies, photos, games, the more and more bandwidth and speed
should be needed to access this data. Hence RF-based technologies Wi-Fi are not the optimal way.

Li-Fi, on the other hand, offer an entirely new paradigm in wireless technologies in communication speed, usability and flexibility, reliability and is a fast and cheap optical version of Wi-Fi. 
It is a based on Visible Light communication medium using Light between 4000 THZ to 375 THZ as optical carrier for data illumination.
